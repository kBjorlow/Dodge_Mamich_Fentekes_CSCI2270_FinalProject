# Dodge_Mamich_Fentekes_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project for CSCI 2270 for Adam Dodge, Rachel Mamich, and Nick Fentekes

Our project will be an addition to Assignment 7. We plan on adding a retun movie function that will add to the inventory, and/or create a new node in the tree. We will also add a user ranking function that allows the user to rate the movies for themselves. We will also add a function to traverse the tree based on the user ranking, and another to traverse the tree based on the actual IMDB ranking.
