# Dodge_Mamich_Fentekes_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project for CSCI 2270 for Adam Dodge, Rachel Mamich, and Nick Fentekes

Project Summary:  
Our project is an addition to Assignment 7. We added a retun movie function that will add to the inventory, and/or create a new node in the tree. We also added a user ranking function that allows the user to rate the movies for themselves. We also added functions to print the movies based on the user ranking and IMDb ranking, along with a function that will print all the movies for a year entered by the user. Another function we created allows the user to recommend a movie, and another allows the user to rent the most recently recommended movie. We also added functions to find the newest and oldest movies in the tree. The last additional function that we added was one that allows the user to rent a random movie.
