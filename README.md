# Dodge_Mamich_Fentekes_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project for CSCI 2270 for Adam Dodge, Rachel Mamich, and Nick Fentekes

Our project will be an addition to Assignment 7. We plan on adding a retun movie function that will add to the inventory, and/or create a new node in the tree. We will also add a user ranking function that allows the user to rate the movies for themselves. We will also add functions to print the movies based on the user ranking, year, and IMDb ranking. We will also create a function to allow the user to recommend a movie, and another to rent the most recently recommended movie. We will also add functions to find the newest and oldest movies in the tree. Another additional function that we will add is to rent a random movie.
